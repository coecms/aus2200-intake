title: AUS2200 UM amip simulation of the 1980 Ash Wednesday bushfire.    
description: |
    A limited area model study of the entire Australian continent at 2.2 km resolution, using the UM atmospheric model. ERA5+ERA5Land reanalysis data was used to provide intial and boundary conditions. The study covers the time period of 1980-02-18 to 1980-02-21, including the 1980 Ash Wednesday bushfires. 
    This dataset is part of the AUS2200 simulations collection.
