title: AUS2200 UM amip simulation of the 2003 Canberra bushfire.
description: |
    A limited area model study of the entire Australian continent at 2.2 km resolution, using the UM atmospheric model. ERA5+ERA5Land reanalysis data was used to provide initial and boundary conditions. The study covers the time period of 2003-01-16 to 2003-01-19, including the 2003 Canberra bushfires.
    This dataset is part of the AUS2200 simulations collection at NCI.
